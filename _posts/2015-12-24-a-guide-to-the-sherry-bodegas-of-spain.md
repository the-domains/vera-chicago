description: 'The oldest sherry bodegas of Spain are national treasures, or should be: vast cathedrals dedicated to thousands of casks of sherries aged by their unique solera system of fractional blending. In that scheme of things, wine from older casks is drawn off into casks filled with younger wine, and that into casks filled with even younger wine, and so on.'
