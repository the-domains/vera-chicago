Vera
wine bar and restaurant is tucked underneath the train tracks in the 
vibrant West Loop neighborhood of Chicago. Owned and operated by the 
husband and wife team of Elizabeth and Mark Mendez, industry veterans 
with over 40 years combined experience. Liz and Mark strive to
create an intimate, cozy, welcoming atmosphere to enjoy Spanish 
influenced cuisine with a well thought out wine and spirits list. Liz 
and Mark met and fell in love while working at another restaurant, and 
knew that eventually they would open their
own place to showcase all the things they were most passionate about. 
In October of 2011 Liz and Mark's dream came true and opened Vera, named
after Mark's maternal grandmother.
